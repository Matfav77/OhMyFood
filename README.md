# OhMyFood
Project in OpenClassrooms's Web Dev Path. 

For this project, detailed layout specifications needed to be followed, in order to render the website as designed in a model. 
Mainly focused on the creation of CSS animations, either via transition or keyframes, and responsiveness with a mobile-first approach.
